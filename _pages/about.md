## What's with the Dinosaurs?

Many moons ago when first starting on Twitter I needed a username, I was young and stupid and decided that RAWR meant Hi in Dinosaur (especially since I was told this as a child) so I went with RAWRitsJ which is still my personal handle today.

However going into Tech it was apparent I was going to need a work handle as well to focus my timeline and tweet more relavant tech and RAWRitsCloud became that handle continuing on the notion that RAWR means Hi in Dinosaur...and that is why we have the Dinosaurs everywhere!
