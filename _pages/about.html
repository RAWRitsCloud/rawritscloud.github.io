                    <p class="card-text">Many moons ago when first starting on Twitter I needed a username, I was young
                        and
                        stupid and decided that RAWR
                        meant Hi in Dinosaur (especially since I was told this as a child) so I went with RAWRitsJ which
                        is
                        still my
                        personal handle today.

                        However going into Tech it was apparent I was going to need a work handle as well to focus my
                        timeline and tweet
                        more relevant tech and RAWRitsCloud became that handle continuing on the notion that RAWR means
                        Hi
                        in Dinosaur...and
                        that is why we have the Dinosaurs everywhere!
