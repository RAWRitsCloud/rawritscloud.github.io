                <h5 class="card-title">What's with the Dinosaurs?</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Many moons ago when first starting on Twitter I needed a username, I was young and stupid and decided that RAWR
                    meant Hi in Dinosaur (especially since I was told this as a child) so I went with RAWRitsJ which is still my
                    personal handle today.
                
                    However going into Tech it was apparent I was going to need a work handle as well to focus my timeline and tweet
                    more relavant tech and RAWRitsCloud became that handle continuing on the notion that RAWR means Hi in Dinosaur...and
                    that is why we have the Dinosaurs everywhere!
